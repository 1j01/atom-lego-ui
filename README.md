## DON'T BOTHER

Nothing is done yet. This repo is public because the instructions told me to fork a template repo, and GitHub doesn't let you make a fork private.

## Development Setup

- Clone this repository
- Open a terminal in this repository's directory
- Run `atom --dev .` to open a Dev Mode Atom window
- Run `apm link --dev` to symlink the repository to `~/.atom/dev/packages`
- Reload Atom using <kbd>Alt+Ctrl+R</kbd>
- Enable the theme via the "UI Theme" drop-down in the "Themes" tab of the Settings View
- Make changes! Since you opened the theme in a Dev Mode window, changes will be instantly reflected in the editor without having to reload.
